The alien has two ears. I don't know what they're for, exactly, but they're the most often 
forgotten part of the alien's body.

Less is more. Take a look at these alien doodles through 
history (http://redditalien.com) and notice that it rarely gets extra details beyond eyebrows 
and modified hands. Always working with a small canvas, drawing more just meant more mess.

When the 
alien needs a special hand (like to wield a sword) try to stick to basic shapes and avoid drawing 
every individual finger, it creeps me out a little to see the alien with fingers. Don't let any 
more of these images haunt me as I sleep.

The alien's eyes are #FF4500 (aka, orangered); don't 
let anyone tell you otherwise.
